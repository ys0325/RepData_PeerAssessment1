##Loading packages required for data analysis
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
Dataset<-read.csv("activity.csv")
#convert varible "date" from factor to date
Dataset$date<-as.Date(Dataset$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```
## Making Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
#Remove NA value in dataset
Dataset<-Dataset[complete.cases(Dataset),]
#Aggregrate total steps by date
DailySteps<-aggregate(steps~date,Dataset, sum)
#Making histogram using plot
 plot(DailySteps$steps~DailySteps$date, type = "h", lwd = 5, xlab = "Date", ylab = "Steps", main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day")
```

## Calculating What mean total number of steps taken per day is:
```{r}
MeanSteps<-mean(DailySteps$steps)
MedianSteps<-median(DailySteps$steps, rm.na = TRUE)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
#Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
AvgIntervalSteps<-aggregate(steps~interval, Dataset, mean)
plot(AvgIntervalSteps, type = "l", lwd = 2, xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Avg Steps per Interval", 
     main = "Average number of steps taken of each interval")
#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
AvgIntervalSteps[which.max(AvgIntervalSteps$steps),]
#Interval No. 835 has the maximum numbers of steps across all the days.
```
## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
